# Asteroid Belt Assualt

Asteroid Belt Assualt is a game made from Microsoft XNA Framework. It's about a lonely asteroid on a quest to go through space and time 
to discover the universe but unfortunately there are evil forces which has vowed to never let him complete his quest. So he must destroy all his enemies to complete his quest. But life isn't so easy for him as he also has to dodge many asteroids that comes in his way. <br />
This was my hobby project done from Microsoft XNA Framework and Visual Studio. Cocos was also available but I found Microsoft XNA Framework more compelling and complete than Cocos so I went with it.
